There are 3 important things that we need to be alert when we are going out. The first one is, do not forget to wear your mask. Secondly, always sanitize your hands and wash your hands properly. Third, avoid getting into a crowded places and practices social distancing. Next, my study. I need to attend online classes and learn at home as we need to follow the order from the government. Its quite hard learning without seeing face to face with the lecturer but due to this circumstances, I need to struggle a bit to make sure I am on the right track.
